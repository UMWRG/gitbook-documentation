# WaterStrategy Scenarios

WaterStrategy Scenarios provide a tool for making targeted adjustments to specific elements within a water management model. These scenarios are particularly useful when you want to experiment with localized changes to parameters, behaviors, or data in a flexible and controlled way.

When a WaterStrategy Scenario is created, it acts as a _fork_ of an existing network model. The original network is assigned to the baseline scenario, which represents the default or starting conditions of the system. From this baseline, a WaterStrategy Scenario allows for precise modifications—whether it’s changing data inputs or adjusting parameters that define the behavior of key elements within the system.

This ability to modify certain aspects of the model while leaving the rest unchanged makes WaterStrategy Scenarios ideal for testing the impact of individual changes. For instance, you can alter reservoir operation rules or modify demand forecasts without needing to reconstruct the entire model. This focused approach helps users quickly assess how specific modifications influence outcomes for refining water management strategies.
