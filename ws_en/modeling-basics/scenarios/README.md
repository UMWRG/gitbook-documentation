# Scenarios

Scenarios in WaterStrategy allow users to simulate and explore various water management strategies by adjusting different elements of a model. They provide a framework for understanding how changes in inputs, assumptions, or data might influence outcomes under different conditions.

&#x20;

WaterStrategy offers two types of scenarios to address various needs in water management modeling:

&#x20;

1. **WaterStrategy Scenarios:** This type is used when users need to adjust specific behaviors, parameters, or data at a localized or smaller scale. These scenarios are ideal for cases where only certain elements of the model need to be tweaked without altering the entire dataset. It allows for targeted modifications, making it easier to test the effects of individual changes within the system.
2. **Pywr-scenarios:** This scenario type is designed to handle more complex cases, particularly those involving uncertainty. It specializes in combining data across multiple scales, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of different variables. This approach is especially useful when working with uncertain inputs or when modeling future conditions, as it enables you to explore how different combinations of data and assumptions may impact the outcomes.
