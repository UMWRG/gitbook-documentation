# Control Curves and Demand Savings

The tutorial on modeling catchment reservoir systems explains how to implement demand reductions based on reservoir storage levels using control curves. By progressively reducing demand when certain thresholds are reached, it helps manage water resources during shortages. It covers steps like defining control curves, associating demand factors, calculating demand, and running simulations to view the effects on reservoir storage and demand under various conditions.
