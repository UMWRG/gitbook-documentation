# Additional Exercises

1. **Use the video below to define a monthly releaes rule that represents a minimum environmental flow downstream of the reservoir.** You are free to define the monthly flows that you feel are appropriate. Please use a new scenario by cloning the **'Demand with GW scenario'.**

&#x20;        _Hint: This can be done by defining a monthly parameter on the Max Flow of the release rule._ How does the environmental flow affect the simulated volume of the reservoir? How does it affect downstream flows? Please show the plots generated for these output parameters.

2. Create a new scenario called **'Dry scenario'** by cloning the **'Demand with GW scenario'**. In this new scenario, update the catchment Flow parameter on the Catchment node to the time series found in column **'Reservoi inflow 1'** from the below link.

How does this inflow scenario impact reservoir storage?&#x20;

Try out different values of **Max Flow** on the Example demand node.
