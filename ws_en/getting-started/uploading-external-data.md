# Uploading External Data

In WaterStrategy, users have the flexibility to manage large and complex datasets more efficiently by loading data from external files as [**DataFrameParameter**](https://water-strategy.gitbook.io/waterstrategy/modeling-basics/parameters/dataframe-parameter) using the "url" keyword, rather than embedding all the data directly into the interface. The file formats include:

* CSV
* Excel
* HDF5

<mark style="background-color:purple;">Note:</mark> Among the previous options, Excel files have the slowest performance while HDF5 files have the best performance and are preferred for large datasets.



To upload a file in WaterStrategy, navigate to your **project** and click on the Files tab. From there, click  **Choose Files** and select the file you want to upload and click <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt="" data-size="line">.&#x20;

This will add the file to your project, making it available for use across all networks within the project.

Once the files have been uploaded, they will be displayed in the **Files** tab within your project. From there, you can easily view, manage, and share them across all networks in the project.
