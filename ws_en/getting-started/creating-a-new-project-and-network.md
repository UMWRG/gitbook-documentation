&#x20;             \-The second output node (off-river) will be used as a water abstraction node.

&#x20;             \-Notice that the catchment node is upriver, and the output node is downriver.                 &#x20;

&#x20;                                         (the Nile flows north in this part and overall)



14. Using the “Links” feature, connect the nodes in the direction of the flow.

&#x20;                   \-This is done by clicking the upflow node first and the downflow node second.
